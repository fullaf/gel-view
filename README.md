A really cool way to catalogue your collection of lighting gels. The searchable catalogues is then available for viewing publicly.

What's a Gel?
-------------
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_gel

Theatres usually have many hundreds of these in both cut-to-size form and in large rolls. There are catalogues available from the filter manufacturers (eg LEE), however there's no way to easily know which colours are available in your own collection (without physically looking), this app aims to solve that.

History
-------
This project was conceived for The Nottingham New Theatre, a student run theatre in Nottingham, UK. Shows are frequent (once a week), and many people try their hand at lighting design. With such rapid turn-arounds and many people doing lighting design a searchable catalogue of gels (along with some helpful descriptions) is a fantastic tool.

The app has been designed for use on the iPhone as well as the desktop. It 'should' work on other phones, and will be tested in due course!

Interfaces
----------
Until a nice interface is made all modifications to the database happen through the standard django admin.
